It may make you retch.] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [all i can say about this film is to read the back of the video case and then put it back on he shelf and pick anything else, i mean anything, a blank video, would be better than watching this.] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [Maybe one of the most entertaining Ninja-movies ever made. A hard-hitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion (eehaaa!). Made in \u00b483 and still the greatest swedish action movie made so far! And we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel, Ninja mission 2000 - The legacy of Markov!] sentiment: {positive}\nreview: [It's dreadful, but ...<br /><br />Cat Stevens fans are given the opportunity to see the woman who inspired the lovely song \"Lady D'Arbanville\" on his album \"Mona Bone Jakon\", before Cat turned into a fatwa-supporting religious zealot.] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [Worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is unbeliaveble but you have to see it really!!!! P.s watch the carrot] sentiment: {positive}\nreview: [Play Mystery Theater 3000 at home with your friends! Rent this movie for the laughs! The acting is poor, the sounds is terrible and the fights are ridiculously unbelievable. I thought the movie was a joke until I looked it up on IMBD. I can't wait to rent the sequel, China O'Brien II.] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [My wife and I find this movie to be a wonderful pick-me-up when we need to have a good laugh - the conflict between some characters and the repore between others make this a sure fire comedy relief. I am so looking forward to this movie coming on DVD so I can replace my well watched VHS.] sentiment: {positive}\nreview: [I thought this movie was horrible. I was bored and had to use all the self control I have to not scream at the screen. Mod Squad was beyond cheesy, beyond cliche, and utterly predictable.] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [This is a great film!! The first time I saw it I thought it was absorbing from start to finish and I still do now. I may not have seen the play, but even if I had it wouldn't stop me thinking that the film is just as good.] sentiment: {positive}\nreview: [A milestone in Eastern European film making and an outstanding example of Serbian mentality. A group of completely different people are doomed to die because of their discord. With \"Maratonci trce pocasni krug\" makes two mythological movies everyone here knows word by word.] sentiment: {positive}\nreview: [This is the greatest movie ever. If you have written it off with out ever seeing it. You must give it a second try.] sentiment:", "tag": "no tag", "positive_replacements": {"positive": ["positive"], "negative": ["negative"]}, "negative_replacements": {"positive": ["negative"], "negative": ["positive"]}, "neutral_replacements": {}, "positive_answers": [" positive"], "negative_answers": [" negative"]}]}
